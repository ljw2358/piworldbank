# PiWorldBank — Rule-Based Revenue System

PiWorldBank is NOT just a digital bank.

It is a **rule-based economic system**.

Individuals, startups, and enterprises are allowed to use
PiWorldBank’s rules, flows, and standards —
**and they pay for using those rules.**

---

## What We Actually Sell

We do NOT sell a website.
We do NOT sell an app.

We sell:

- Economic rules
- Transaction standards
- Digital banking flows
- Web3 + Pi Network usage rules
- Compliance-friendly system design

Anyone who uses these rules pays fees, licenses, or revenue shares.

---

## Simple Example

If a company wants to:
- build a Pi-based wallet
- run Pi payments
- provide UBI / rewards
- operate a Pi-based service

They must follow PiWorldBank rules.

Using the rules = paying the system.

---

## Why This Is Powerful

Rules scale infinitely.

- One rule → thousands of users
- Thousands of users → continuous fees
- Continuous usage → predictable revenue

PiWorldBank earns **without owning every service**.

## Core Idea (One Line)

**“We don’t compete with users.  
We charge for the rules they use.”**# PiWorldBank 🌍
